### Step 1: Introduction

Let's begin our adventure by delving into the enchanting world of **dictionary manipulation**. In this lab, we'll explore various techniques to create, access, modify, and operate on dictionaries, unraveling their hidden powers and unlocking their magic!

### Step 2: Creating and Accessing Dictionaries

Before we dive deeper, let's review the basics of creating and accessing dictionaries. We'll cover techniques for creating dictionaries, accessing values using keys, and retrieving keys and values as separate entities.

```python
# Example:
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

# Accessing values using keys
student_name = student["name"]
print("Student Name:", student_name)

# Retrieving keys and values separately
keys = student.keys()
values = student.values()
print("Keys:", keys)
print("Values:", values)
```

### Step 3: Modifying and Adding to Dictionaries

Now, let's explore techniques to modify dictionaries. We'll cover techniques for changing existing values, adding new key-value pairs, and removing key-value pairs from a dictionary.

```python
# Example:
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

# Modifying existing values
student["age"] = 21
print("Modified Student:", student)

# Adding new key-value pairs
student["school"] = "XYZ School"
print("Student with School:", student)

# Removing key-value pairs
del student["grade"]
print("Student without Grade:", student)
```

### Step 4: Dictionary Operations

Dictionary manipulation becomes even more magical when we explore various dictionary operations. We'll cover techniques such as checking if a key exists, retrieving the length of a dictionary, and looping through key-value pairs.

```python
# Example:
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A"
}

# Checking if a key exists
if "age" in student:
    print("Age exists in the dictionary.")

# Retrieving the length of a dictionary
length = len(student)
print("Length of Student Dictionary:", length)

# Looping through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

### Step 5: Challenge

Now it's time for an exciting challenge! Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence. Create a dictionary where the keys are the words in the sentence, and the values are the lengths of those words. Print

 the resulting dictionary.

### Step 6: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the "Dictionary Wizard: Unveiling the Magic of Dictionaries" guided lab! You've gained valuable insights into the world of dictionary manipulation and harnessed the mystical powers of Python dictionaries.

Remember to keep practicing and exploring new concepts. Dictionaries are magical data structures that offer limitless possibilities in various programming tasks!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Enjoy your future coding adventures, and may the magic of dictionaries guide your path! ðŸŽ‰
